<h4 align="center">Note: A full install of a supported Linux distro is required! Live USB sessions will not work.</h4>

# Instructions
1.     git clone https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio
2.     cd chromebook-linux-audio
3.     ./setup-audio

# Requirements
1. `python 3.10`
2. `git`

# Supported Devices
See the [Chrultrabook docs](https://docs.chrultrabook.com/docs/firmware/supported-devices.html) for more info.

# Officially Supported Distros
1. Alpine Linux
2. Arch Linux
3. Debian 12
4. Fedora 40/41
5. Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)
6. OpenSUSE
7. PopOS
8. Void Linux

# Ubuntu
I do not officially support Ubuntu, and by that I mean I don't provide support for it. The script will warn you of this. However, I do not prevent you from running the script on Ubuntu. Despite the warning from the script, it will still run everything it normally would. If you run the script on Ubuntu and it works, great. If it doesn't work, you are on your own.

# Other Distros
Other distros will likely work but will require you to manually install packages. The script will print a list of any packages you may need to install.

# Donations
If you would like to support the work I do, consider donating [here](https://paypal.me/weirdtreething).
